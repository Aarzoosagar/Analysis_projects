Food Delivery Analysis
 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing food delivery data to uncover customer behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery trends. The dataset includes details about orders, customers, restaurants, delivery partners, and payment methods.

Using tools like Python, Excel, Power BI, and Looker Studio, the analysis provides both exploratory data insights and interactive dashboards for better decision-making.
